                        <h3>Short Term Health Insurance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Short Term Health Insurance (STM) was introduced to the market for people who needed help
                            covering gaps in coverage and it is not an "Obamacare" plan under the Affordable Care Act.
                            The plans offer a range of deductibles, co-pay, and max out of pocket options to create more
                            comprehensive or more affordable options for the insured. The duration of a STM plan is
                            determined by the carrier and the state laws, ranging from 3 months to 12. Everyone is not
                            eligible for STM plans, some coverages & health benefits are not covered by them, and you
                            can be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Indemnity Insurance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some plans have names like Health Benefit Indemnity, Fixed Indemnity, and Limited Medical
                            Indemnity. These plans have a different financial structure than traditional major medical
                            health insurance plans and they are not major medical or Obamacare plans. Instead of co-pays
                            and deductibles, Indemnity plans offer you "first dollar" coverage which is a cash benefit
                            policy holders will receive if they have a doctors office or hospital visit. The coverage
                            and benefit levels will vary for Indemnity plans and those differences will be seen in the
                            premiums paid for the coverage. Indemnity also can include supplemental medical insurance
                            coverage for critical illnesses or accidents, as well as non insurance supplemental health
                            benefits such as telemedicine, insurance advocacy, and pharmacy.

                    <div>
                        <h3>Supplemental Health Products</h3>
                        <p>Many Short Term and Indemnity plans will also be sold with supplemental health products, some
                            of these are insurance products and some are not. Most commonly these are dental, vision,
                            critical illness, emergency medical, and accidental death & dismemberment (AD&D) insurance
                            plans. They can also be products like telemedicine for 24/7 access to medical providers,
                            insurance advocacy services to help you take advantage of your plans, pharmacy benefits for
                            discounted prescriptions, and other group association discounts.</p>

                        <h3>Other Insurance Options</h3>
                        <p>HealthInsurance.net also works with a network of insurance providers and insurance marketing
                            companies to help consumers find affordable options.</p>
                        <p>This site does not provide Affordable Care Act (ACA) Plans. Visit healthcare.gov for ACA
                            plans. Short Term Health Insurance and Health Benefit Indemnity insurance (HBI) are
                            insurance outside of the ACA. Short Term Health Insurance and HBI do not cover pre-existing
                            conditions and do not include all ten of the minimum essential benefits of the ACA. You may
                            be subject to the ACA Uninsured Tax (eliminated by the Congressional Tax Reform Act starting
                            in 2019).</p>
